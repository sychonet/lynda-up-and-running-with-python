# Up and running with Python
### Course on [Lynda](https://lynda.com)

I did this introductory course about Python programming language on the e-learning platform [Lynda](https://lynda.com) to learn the basics of the language. I also earned a [certificate of completion](Certificate.pdf) at the end of the course. During this introductory course I learned a lot about basic concepts like variables, functions and loops. Some of the more advanced features supported the language that I learned during this course were :
* OS path module
* shell utilities
* date formatting
* JSON, HTML and XML parsing
* File Handling
* urllib2 library in Python
