### Course on [Lynda](https://lynda.com)

I did this introductory course about Python programming language on the e-learning platform [Lynda](https://lynda.com) to learn the basics of the language. I also earned a [certificate of completion](Certificate.pdf) at the end of the course. During this introductory course I learned a lot about basic concepts like variables, functions and loops. Moreover I also learned a lot about
